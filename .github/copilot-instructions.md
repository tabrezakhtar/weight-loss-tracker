## JavaScript Requirements
- prefer speech marks over single quotes for strings and imports. e.g. import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
- indent code using 2 spaces.
- prefer useEffect hooks to have no dependencies passed in.  I do not want them to re-run unless explicitly stated.
- do not comment the code unless explicitly stated.
- use emojis instead of svgs when creating code that uses icons.
- prefer using the context api for any components that use state, instead of passing in callback functions.
- when writing css, prefer to use tailwind.
- do not use inline style tags
## Folder Structure
- keep the folder structure flat unless explicity told to do otherwise.
## Chat Behaviour
- there is no need to explain the changes you have made to the code if in agent mode.  If I ask a question in Ask mode, then please explain.
- do not run the app to check terminal output.
